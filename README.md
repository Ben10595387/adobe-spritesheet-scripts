# Sprite Sheet Scripts for Adobe Creative Suite

Contained herein is a set of handy scripts for automating the manipulation of tiled sprite sheets within Adobe Creative Suite. The scripts have been written with Unreal Engine content creators in mind, but they may prove useful for other purposes.

## Script 1: Sprite Sheet from After Effects Composition

This script enables the user to create a sprite sheet directly from an After Effects composition and have it saved automatically in multiple different sizes.

## Script 2: Sprite Sheet from Photoshop Layers

This script works much the same as the first one, except it is intended to be used from within Photoshop rather than After Effects. This may be useful in cases where the source images already exist or weren't created in After Effects. The user can either import a set of image files from the file system, or use the layers from the current document.

## Script 3: Sprite Sheet Splitter

This script is designed to split an existing sprite sheet back into individual frames so that they can be manipulated and rearranged easily. This may be useful when the source files are not available for a particular sprite sheet.
