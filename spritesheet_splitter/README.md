# Sprite Sheet Splitter

Intended for Unreal Engine content creators, this script enables the user to split a grid-like sprite sheet
into Photoshop layers. After editing, they can be re-assembled using the "Sprite Sheet from Photoshop Layers" script.

Feel free to distribute and mangle this script as you like, but please give credit where it is due.
